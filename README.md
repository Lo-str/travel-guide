# Project Structure

- **index.ts**
  Entry point of the application.
  Starts the CLI menu, **no logic**.

---

## `cli/` — Command Line Interface

Handles **all interaction with the user** in the terminal.

- **cli.ts**
  Contains the main menu loop.
  Displays options and routes user choices.

- **handlers.ts**
  Contains functions that respond to menu actions
  (e.g., create trip, add activity, view budget).

---

## `models/` — Data definitions

Defines the **TypeScript types** used across the app.
No logic is stored here, only data structures.

- **trip.ts**
  Describes the shape of a **Trip**, including destination, start date, and activities.

- **activity.ts**
  Describes the shape of an **Activity**, including name, cost, category, and start time.

These models ensure **strict typing**.

---

## `services/` — Business logic

Contains the core functionality.

- **destination.ts**
  Fetches country information (currency, flag) from an external API.

- **itinerary.ts**
  Manages trips and activities:
  - create trips
  - add activities
  - filter by category
  - sort chronologically

- **budget.ts**
  Calculates total trip cost and identifies high-cost activities.

---

## Summary

```
CLI → Services → Models → Data
```

- **CLI** talks to the user
- **Services** perform the logic
- **Models** define the data structure

This separation improves **readability, teamwork, and maintainability**.
